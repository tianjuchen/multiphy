Coding Jacobians can be a difficult and tedious task, especially for physics that require complex material models. Instead of spending their time running simulations and generating results, physicists and engineers may sink days or weeks into constructing accurate Jacobians. Oftentimes, the developer will just throw up their hands and elect an approximate Jacobian method like <span>Preconditioned Jacobian Free Newton Krylov (PJFNK)</span> where the Jacobian is never explicitly formed but instead its action on vectors is approximated using finite differences and an approximate preconditioning matrix is hand coded for constructing an effective preconditioner. While effective in many cases, the quality of the matrix-free approximation is closely tied to selection of a differencing parameter whose size should vary based on the noisiness of the nonlinear system of equations. If the nonlinear functions are noisy and too small of a differencing parameter is chosen, truncation will lead to a Jacobian approximation that is actually a non-linear operator. If the differencing parameter is too large, then the approximated derivatives will be inaccurate if the differenced function is nonlinear. For multi-physics problems in which the magnitudes of solution and residual components may vary wildly, an arbitrary choice of differencing parameter may lead to an accurate approximation of the Jacobian action for one physics but lead to the aforementioned truncation error in another. The presence of truncation error and hence a non-linear operator is evident in a linear solve derived from porous flow equations coupled with heat transport:</p><pre class="moose-pre"><code class="language-text">

</code></pre><p>Given the multi-physics aim of MOOSE and the clear pitfalls associated with differencing approximations, there is clear motivation to form accurate explicit representations of the matrix. Note, even if a perfect Jacobian action can be achieved via the finite difference scheme, a suitable preconditioning matrix is required to construct a robust and efficient solver.</p><p>Some users elect to use symbolic differentiation packages like SymPy or Mathematica; however, for functions of any complexity the resulting gradient expressions can take up to several pages and can be quite difficult to translate from notebook to code. An alternative to numerical and symbolic differentiation is <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="automatic differentiation" data-position="top" data-delay="50">AD</span>, which applies the chain rule to elementary operations at every step of the computer program and which applies at most a small constant factor (estimated to have an upper bound of 5) of additional arithmetic operations. Weighed against the untold number of developer hours sunk into attempting to create accurate hand-coded Jacobians and analyst hours spent waiting for problems with poor hand-coded or approximated Jacobians to converge, the small additional CPU cost imposed by <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="automatic differentiation" data-position="top" data-delay="50">AD</span> seemed well worth the trade. With an accurate Jacobian formed using <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="automatic differentiation" data-position="top" data-delay="50">AD</span>, the overall simulation  can be much faster than that utilizing a deficient hand-coded matrix. Having elected to pursue AD, there was a choice between forward and reverse modes. Forward mode <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="automatic differentiation" data-position="top" data-delay="50">AD</span> is best suited for problems with many more outputs than inputs; reverse mode is best suited for many more inputs than outputs. The latter case is more prevalent in deep learning applications and is what is implemented in popular machine learning libraries like PyTorch. In solution of nonlinear systems of equations the number of inputs and outputs are equivalent, so the choice is not clear-cut. However, given the architecture of MOOSE in which the residuals are constructed from finite element solutions, which themselves are naturally constructed from the nonlinear degrees of freedom, forward propagation was the logical choice. Forward-mode AD relies on the concept of <code>DualNumbers</code> which can be implemented either through source code transformation or operator overloading. The latter is more easily implemented in programming languages that support it such as C++, the language that MOOSE is written in. Conveniently, the C++ header-only library MetaPhysicL came ready-made with a <code>DualNumber</code>  template class and an operator-overload <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="automatic differentiation" data-position="top" data-delay="50">AD</span> implementation that fit into the MOOSE architecture with minimal disruption to the code-base. The <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="automatic differentiation" data-position="top" data-delay="50">AD</span> capability of MetaPhysicL was merged into the MOOSE code-base in the fall of 2018.</p></section><section class="scrollspy" id="c2288a4a-c041-40ce-8ce6-2e4ed0178770" data-section-level="2" data-section-text="AD implementation - MetaPhysicL"><h2 id="ad-implementation-metaphysicl">AD implementation - MetaPhysicL</h2><p>The automatic differentiation classes in MetaPhysicL were originally developed and tested in the Manufactured Analytical Solution Abstraction (<code>MASA</code>) library, used for generating manufactured solution tests for increasingly complicated physics simulations, when it was discovered that multiple symbolic differentiation packages were suffering software failures on sufficiently large problems.  Symbolically differentiating manufactured solution fields through e.g.\ 3-D Navier-Stokes physics caused a combinatorial explosion, leading to corresponding forcing functions that were hundreds of kilobytes in length, or required many man-hours of manual simplification, or failed altogether on some Computer Algebra System software.  Automatic differentiation allowed for the generation of manufactured solution forcing functions using code that was hardly more complex than the physics equations themselves.

MetaPhysicL overloads binary arithmetic operators (<code>+,-,*,/</code>), unary functions (<code>std::sin, std::cos, std::exp</code> etc.), and binary functions (<code>std::pow, std::max, std::min</code> etc.), ensuring that any calculation involving a <code>DualNumber</code> propagates both the function value and its derivatives.</p><p>MOOSE leverages one of two MetaPhysicL container class templates depending on user configuration. The default MOOSE configuration uses the <code>NumberArray</code> class template which accepts <code>std::size_t N</code> and <code>typename T</code> template arguments where <code>N</code> denotes the length of an underlying C-array that holds the <code>NumberArray</code> data and <code>T</code> is the floating-point type held by the C-array. As for <code>DualNumber</code>, MetaPhysicL provides arithmetic, unary, and binary function overloads for manipulation of its container types. <code>NumberArray</code> is an ideal derivative container choice when there is dense coupling between physics variables; this is because operator and function overloads for <code>NumberArray</code> operate on the entire underlying C-array. The second MetaPhysicL container class leveraged by MOOSE is <code>SemiDynamicSparseNumberArray</code>, which is a more ideal choice for problems in which variable coupling is sparse or when a user wishes to solve a variety of problems with a single library configuration. In contrast to <code>NumberArray</code> which only holds a single C-array of floating-type data, <code>SemiDynamicSparseNumberArray</code> additionally holds an array (as a <code>std::array</code>) of integers corresponding to dof indices. The existence of this additional data member enables sparse operations that may involve only a subset of the elements in the underlying floating-point data. As an explicit example of when these sparse operations are useful, consider a user who may configure MOOSE with an underlying derivative storage container size of 81 for solid mechanics simulations on 3D second-order hexagonal finite elements (3 displacement variables * 27 degrees of freedom per variable per finite element = 81 local dofs). When running 3D, second-order cases, the non-sparse <code>NumberArray</code> container would be 100\% efficient. However, if the user wishes to run a 2D, second-order case with the same MOOSE configuration, they would be performing <span class="moose-katex-inline-equation" id="moose-equation-cbd07b82-df03-40c2-bb17-6d9166866102"><script>var element = document.getElementById("moose-equation-cbd07b82-df03-40c2-bb17-6d9166866102");katex.render("81 / 18 = 4.5", element, {displayMode:false,throwOnError:false,macros:{"\\bs":"\\boldsymbol{#1}","\\grad":"\\bs{\\nabla}","\\divergence":"\\grad \\cdot","\\norm":"\\left\\lVert#1\\right\\rVert","\\abs":"\\left\\lvert#1\\right\\rvert","\\diff":"\\text{ d}#1","\\bfa":"\\boldsymbol{a}","\\bfb":"\\boldsymbol{b}","\\bfc":"\\boldsymbol{c}","\\bfd":"\\boldsymbol{d}","\\bfe":"\\boldsymbol{e}","\\bff":"\\boldsymbol{f}","\\bfg":"\\boldsymbol{g}","\\bfh":"\\boldsymbol{h}","\\bfi":"\\boldsymbol{i}","\\bfj":"\\boldsymbol{j}","\\bfk":"\\boldsymbol{k}","\\bfl":"\\boldsymbol{l}","\\bfm":"\\boldsymbol{m}","\\bfn":"\\boldsymbol{n}","\\bfo":"\\boldsymbol{o}","\\bfp":"\\boldsymbol{p}","\\bfq":"\\boldsymbol{q}","\\bfr":"\\boldsymbol{r}","\\bfs":"\\boldsymbol{s}","\\bft":"\\boldsymbol{t}","\\bfu":"\\boldsymbol{u}","\\bfv":"\\boldsymbol{v}","\\bfw":"\\boldsymbol{w}","\\bfx":"\\boldsymbol{x}","\\bfy":"\\boldsymbol{y}","\\bfz":"\\boldsymbol{z}","\\bfA":"\\boldsymbol{A}","\\bfB":"\\boldsymbol{B}","\\bfC":"\\boldsymbol{C}","\\bfD":"\\boldsymbol{D}","\\bfE":"\\boldsymbol{E}","\\bfF":"\\boldsymbol{F}","\\bfG":"\\boldsymbol{G}","\\bfH":"\\boldsymbol{H}","\\bfI":"\\boldsymbol{I}","\\bfJ":"\\boldsymbol{J}","\\bfK":"\\boldsymbol{K}","\\bfL":"\\boldsymbol{L}","\\bfM":"\\boldsymbol{M}","\\bfN":"\\boldsymbol{N}","\\bfO":"\\boldsymbol{O}","\\bfP":"\\boldsymbol{P}","\\bfQ":"\\boldsymbol{Q}","\\bfR":"\\boldsymbol{R}","\\bfS":"\\boldsymbol{S}","\\bfT":"\\boldsymbol{T}","\\bfU":"\\boldsymbol{U}","\\bfV":"\\boldsymbol{V}","\\bfW":"\\boldsymbol{W}","\\bfX":"\\boldsymbol{X}","\\bfY":"\\boldsymbol{Y}","\\bfZ":"\\boldsymbol{Z}"}});</script></span> times more work than is necessary if using <code>NumberArray</code>.

In general, the quality of automatic differention results are verified with unit testing in MetaPhysicL and using a <code>PetscJacobianTester</code> in MOOSE which compares the Jacobian produced by automatic differentiation against that generated using finite differencing of the residuals. The latter test relies on using well-scaled problems; for poorly-scaled problems floating point errors can result in a loss in accuracy of the finite-differenced Jacobian.</p><section id="a0326e6f-d66a-45ee-8244-b625985fffb9" data-section-level="3" data-section-text="Using AD in MOOSE"><h3 id="using-ad-in-moose">Using AD in MOOSE</h3><p>Leveraging the automatic differentiation capabilities in MOOSE is as simple as inheriting from our AD base classes, e.g. <code>ADKernel, ADIntegratedBC, ADDGKernel,
ADNodalBC</code>, etc. The only method an application developer has to override is <code>computeQpResidual</code> or if deriving from <code>ADKernelGrad</code> or <code>ADKernelValue</code>, then override <code>precomputeQpResidual</code>. To couple in AD variables, the application developer should use methods like <code>adCoupledValue, adCoupledGradient,
adCoupledSecond</code> etc. inherited through the <a href="../source/interfaces/Coupleable.html"><code>Coupleable</code></a> interface.

Currently, MOOSE&#x27;s default maximum AD container size is 53. If the maximum AD container size is exceeded, then an error will result. If a quantity needs to depend on more degrees of freedom than the maximum AD container size, then MOOSE needs to be reconfigured: go to the root of the MOOSE repository and run the following, where <code>n</code> should be substituted with the desired size.</p><pre class="moose-pre"><code class="language-text">
